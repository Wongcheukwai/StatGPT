### Notable Trends or Observations
- Revenue growth was modest, primarily driven by an increase in membership subscriptions and interest income, despite declines in rental and other revenue.
- Expenses saw a notable increase, particularly in legal costs and administration expenses, which significantly impacted the overall surplus.
- The absence of gains from investment property revaluation this year contributed to a lower total comprehensive income compared to the previous year.

### Narrative Summary
The financial performance for the year shows a slight increase in total revenue, primarily due to higher membership subscriptions and interest income. However, this was offset by a significant rise in expenses, especially in legal and administration costs, leading to a reduced surplus. The absence of gains from investment property revaluation further impacted the total comprehensive income, resulting in a notable decrease compared to the previous year. Overall, while revenue streams remain stable, cost management appears to be a critical area for improvement to enhance future financial outcomes.
