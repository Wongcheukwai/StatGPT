### Narrative Summary

The financial position reflects a strategic shift with substantial investments in non-current assets, notably land and buildings, which have significantly increased the total asset base. This expansion has been financed through new borrowings, leading to a marked rise in non-current liabilities. Current assets have decreased, primarily due to a reduction in cash and cash equivalents, while trade receivables have improved. Overall, the company has strengthened its equity position, with retained earnings showing healthy growth, suggesting a positive outlook despite the increased leverage.
