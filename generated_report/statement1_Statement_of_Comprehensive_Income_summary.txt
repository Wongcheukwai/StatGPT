### Short Narrative Summary
The financial performance for the year shows a modest increase in total revenue, primarily due to higher membership subscriptions and interest income. However, this was offset by a substantial rise in expenses, notably in legal and administration costs, leading to a significant reduction in the surplus for the year. The absence of gains from investment property revaluation further contributed to a decrease in total comprehensive income compared to the previous year. Overall, while revenue streams remain stable, cost management appears to be a critical area for improvement.
