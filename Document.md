# StatGPT: GenAI Financial Statement Analysis

## Approach
The **StatGPT** system automates financial statement analysis using **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, specifically OpenAI models, to extract, preprocess, and generate insights from financial documents. The system is designed to process **financial statements in PDF format**, extract key financial metrics, and generate structured summary reports. The core methodology includes:

### 1. Data Extraction
- PDFs are converted to images for processing.
- OpenAI Vision model is used to extract structured financial data from images.
- Extracted data is formatted into structured JSON.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Raw extracted data is cleaned, normalized, and validated.
- Missing values are handled, ensuring numerical consistency.
- The structured data is stored for downstream analysis.

### 3. Report Generation
- The preprocessed financial data is analyzed using **GPT-4 Turbo**.
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** enhances contextual understanding of financial statements.
- The system generates a structured summary including **key metrics, trends, and narrative insights**.

### 4. Evaluation
- Generated summaries are automatically evaluated for fluency, coherence, relevance, and conciseness.
- The evaluation module ensures extracted data aligns with the actual financial reports.

The system supports **cloud scalability** through **S3 integration and PySpark support** (optional), enabling large-scale financial data processing.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Financial Data Extraction from PDFs
**Challenge:** Extracting structured financial data from PDFs is difficult due to **varied layouts, tabular formats, and multi-page content**.

**Solution:**
- Used **OpenAI Vision API** to extract text from financial PDFs.
- Implemented **image-based parsing** to enhance accuracy for non-textual financial tables.
- Ensured consistency in extracted data by preserving the original table structures.

### 2. Model Selection for Financial Report Analysis
**Challenge:** Since there is no access to a large proprietary dataset of financial statements, **fine-tuning was not feasible**.

**Solution:**
- Used **pre-trained OpenAI LLMs (GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o)** to leverage existing generalization capabilities.
- Designed **custom system prompts** to guide LLMs for structured financial metric extraction.
- Optimized token limits and API calls for cost-efficient analysis.

### 3. Handling Long Financial Documents Efficiently
**Challenge:** Financial statements contain **multiple sections and large amounts of data**, making it difficult for models to maintain context.

**Solution:**
- Implemented **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to efficiently retrieve relevant financial context.
- Used **chunking techniques** with **overlapping segments** to ensure no data loss in financial reports.
- Optimized **embedding-based retrieval** to provide accurate context for LLM-based summarization.

## Scalability Considerations

**Challenge:** The system must efficiently handle multiple financial statements while ensuring stability and performance in production environments.

**Solution:**
- **Batch Processing for PDFs:** Implemented a pipeline that processes multiple PDFs sequentially, ensuring efficient execution without overwhelming API limits.
- **Cloud Storage Integration:** The extracted and processed data can be stored in **AWS S3**, enabling easy access for distributed processing.
- **PySpark for Large-Scale Data Handling:** The system includes an optional **PySpark integration** for handling large volumes of financial documents in distributed environments.
- **Efficient API Utilization:** OpenAI API calls are optimized to minimize latency and cost while ensuring high accuracy in text extraction and summarization.
- **Logging and Monitoring:** The system implements structured logging to track processing steps, errors, and API usage, which is critical for debugging and scalability improvements.
